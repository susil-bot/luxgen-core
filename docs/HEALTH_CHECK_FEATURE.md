# Enhanced Health Check Feature

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing health check endpoints with detailed system metrics and monitoring capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `/health` Endpoint
- Added system information including Node.js version, platform, and architecture
- Included detailed memory usage statistics
- Added formatted uptime display
- Added CPU usage information

### 2. New `/health/metrics` Endpoint
- Provides detailed system metrics in JSON format
- Includes memory usage breakdown (RSS, heap, external, array buffers)
- CPU usage statistics (user and system time)
- System information (Node.js version, platform, architecture, PID)
- Formatted uptime display

## API Endpoints

### GET `/health`
Returns basic health status with enhanced system information.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T09:57:51.166Z",
  "service": "luxgen-trainer-platform-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "uptime": 632,
  "uptimeFormatted": "0h 10m 32s",
  "environment": "development",
  "system": {
    "nodeVersion": "v20.14.0",
    "platform": "darwin",
    "arch": "x64",
    "memory": {
      "rss": "45MB",
      "heapTotal": "12MB",
      "heapUsed": "8MB",
      "external": "2MB"
    },
    "cpuUsage": {
      "user": 123456,
      "system": 78901
    }
  }
}
```

### GET `/health/metrics`
Returns detailed system metrics for monitoring and debugging.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T09:57:51.166Z",
  "uptime": {
    "seconds": 632,
    "formatted": "0h 10m 32s"
  },
  "memory": {
    "rss": 47185920,
    "heapTotal": 12582912,
    "heapUsed": 8388608,
    "external": 2097152,
    "arrayBuffers": 0
  },
  "cpu": {
    "user": 123456,
    "system": 78901
  },
  "system": {
    "nodeVersion": "v20.14.0",
    "platform": "darwin",
    "arch": "x64",
    "pid": 12345
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Provides detailed system metrics for production monitoring
2. **Debugging Support**: Helps identify memory leaks and performance issues
3. **Health Checks**: Enables better health monitoring for load balancers and monitoring systems
4. **System Information**: Provides runtime environment details for troubleshooting

## Usage

These endpoints can be used by:
- Load balancers for health checks
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- DevOps teams for system monitoring
- Development teams for debugging

## Testing

Test the endpoints:
```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Detailed metrics
curl http://localhost:3001/health/metrics
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add database connection metrics
- Include request/response statistics
- Add custom application metrics
- Implement metrics aggregation over time
